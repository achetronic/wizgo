A golang library to control your WiZ lights

> At this moment, the library is not covering the whole API as it is discovered by reverse engineering 
> If you want to cover more things, consider [contributing](#how-to-contribute)

## Motivation

Domotic devices are cool, but they will be cooler when [Matter](https://csa-iot.org/all-solutions/matter/) 
protocol lands, finally, into the industry.

As a fact, before Matter, only some protocols such as Zigbee had some standardization mercy.

But there are a lot of devices out there connected by Wi-Fi, and they are completely non-standard. 
Manufacturers decided to design them without thinking about potential integration between different stuff.

The big question is: what are you doing with your legacy WiZ devices that are not going to be updated by the company,
once when Matter has landed? Are you thinking about throwing them to the trash?

With this library you can make your own automations with them. 
And now it's as easy as you should forgive about throwing... what?

## Methods

Just read these wonderful lines:

```go
package main

import (
	"log"

	// Include the library in your code
	"github.com/achetronic/wizgo/pkg/wizgo"
)

func main() {

	// The first step is to start a client to interact with your devices
	wizClient, err := wizgo.CreateWizClient("192.168.2.107", 38899)

	// Devices can be turned on/off with single commands
	_, err = wizClient.TurnOn()
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("error turning on the light: %s", err)
	}

	// Lights can be visually found sending a pulse
	_, err = wizClient.Pulse()
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("error sending a pulse: %s", err)
	}

	// Scenes are supported too. Just set the ID you want
	_, err = wizClient.SetScene(35)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("error setting the scene: %s", err)
	}

	// May be you want to set the speed for a party?
	_, err = wizClient.SetSpeed(200)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("error setting the speed: %s", err)
	}

	// Oh, some romantic moment. Understood.
	_, err = wizClient.SetTemperature(2000)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("error setting temperature: %s", err)
	}

	// Studying is better with bright light
	_, err = wizClient.SetColdWhite(255)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("error setting cold white level: %s", err)
	}

	// But if it's too much, brightness can be set
	_, err = wizClient.SetBrightness(100)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("error setting the brightness level: %s", err)
	}

	// Feel like Grinch-y today?
	_, err = wizClient.SetRgb(0, 255, 0)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("error setting the color: %s", err)
	}

	// Let me sleep, uh?
	_, err = wizClient.TurnOff()
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("error turning off the device: %s", err)
	}

	// There are a lot of more things implemented
	_, err = wizClient.GetPilot()
	_, err = wizClient.GetModelConfig()
	_, err = wizClient.GetDevInfo()
	_, err = wizClient.GetSystemConfig()
	_, err = wizClient.SetRatio(100)
	_, err = wizClient.SetWarmWhite(100)
	_, err = wizClient.IsDw()
	_, err = wizClient.IsTw()
	_, err = wizClient.IsRgb()
	_, err = wizClient.IsSceneAvailable(32)
	_, err = wizClient.Registration("192.168.2.173", "704F7C84524A", true)
}
